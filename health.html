              In terms of running, I've had better days. I was pretty consistently running, but ran into issues! My right leg began to hurt so I'm taking some time
            to practice RICE. That's Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Hopefully I'll be back in a couple days time and we're just having some shin splints.

              In terms of biking, there's been none. My brother borrowed my bike almost 3 years ago and apparently it's at his girlfriends house to this day. I'm not convinced I'll ever see that orange beauty again.

              In terms of swimming, there's been none as well sorry to dissapoint. First of all it's April and it's getting nicer but it's nowhere near where it needs
              to be for me to start swimming. On top of that beaches and pools both are too large of gatherings so maybe once this whole thing is over!
