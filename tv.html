                  To start off, I watched a throwback, Avatar the Last Airbender. It was great, and I definitley remember why I liked it so much
                  as a kid. It was so hard to stop watching and I've always wished they could make a follow up of some sort. Which leads me into my next show.

            <div class="healthp">
              The next show I watched (kinda, i'm currently in the middle of it) is the follow up. The show has been alright so far, but I don't think the same
              level of writing or plot is here. Excited to see where it goes, but so far the villans, enemies, etc have not been very good.

            <div class="healthp">
              <br>
              Lastly, I watched part of the series, a different world. It's been alright but nothing special. It's definitley been different from other shows I've
              been watching, but other than that it's nothing special. They cut the main character after season one for no apparent reason but hey, I'm no director.
